# 🛒 Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting

This is a side project I'm working on to improve my skills in time series forecasting, machine learning, and real-world data analysis. It is based on the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting) involving sales prediction for grocery stores in Ecuador.


## 🔍 Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict future sales based on historical data, oil prices, holidays, and store/product metadata.

This project is part of my personal learning journey into:
- Feature engineering for time series
- Model evaluation and selection
- Real-world forecasting challenges
